#### Beyond 200 OK

Most of the systems we interact with today are relying on API calls. Knowingly or unknowingly we are hitting many APIs in our day-to-day life. Just like Television remote buttons perform different actions, APIs are designed to perform certain actions and help communicate with the computer applications. Every day several APIs are developed and adapted based on the needs of the organizations. With the usage of these APIs, developers can create quality applications. Due to that, we see a lot of organizations are giving importance to API Testing. Increasing API-First companies are also one of the major reasons for the attention towards API Testing.

While Testing the APIs, we focus on certain universal standards and we miss exploring beyond that. For instance, getting the status code as 200 OK is the expected result and we are happy that the API is up and running. Other than the response codes we need to focus on the headers, response body, response time, and cookies, and there are many other things to be focused on during your API Testing process. You need to ensure that the APIs are robust, reliable, scalable, and resilient. Also automating your API tests helps you to test efficiently, and deploy quickly.

If you are looking to elevate your API Testing process, this is the talk for you. I will share all the lessons and experiences I gained from my failures.

Takeaways:

*   Knowledge of the importance of API Testing, challenges, and best practices in API Testing
*   Learning the types of API tests along with the basic performance and security tests
*   Deep dive into the validations performed
*   Develop Test Suite and strategies for API automation
*   Utilize parameterization to increase coverage
